# Maintainers read the CRA! Feedback Repo

## Context
For too long, governments have engaged with "the open source community" through large companies and foundations- which represent, at best, a shallow, incomplete perspective of the greater open source community, a majority of which is composed of independent maintainers and small business owners.

The Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is an EU regulation proposed in 2022 by the for improving cybersecurity and cyber resilience through common cybersecurity standards, for products with hardware and software whose intended and foreseeable use includes a data connection to a device or network.

We have about 2 years to get ahead of the requirements. We‚Äôd love to talk through the annoyances that projects could feel, possible work being asked for by companies that are consumers of your projects, and we are most excited about the potential opportunity for the projects to make the money instead of third party vendors around the upcoming ‚Äúobligations‚Äù.

## How to participate in this repo
We welcome everyone to post their questions as [new issues][new], and the team will do their best to answer them! You can also check [the open issues][issues] to see what other people asked and the answers to their questions. If you can't open GitHub issues or want to send questions privately you can send them via email to <hello@axo.dev>.

Please note that if an issue is labelled [`answered`] the team will not return to it, so if you have a follow up question, please post it as a new issue.

## FAQ and Feedback Package

Periodically, we'll be summarizing the set of questions and answers on the issue tracker and collecting them into both an FAQ and a feedback package. More on this to come after the first wave of questions! 

## Live sessions

More sessions will be added after the Kickoff once we've received feedback on the format and times.

### Things to keep in mind

Please keep in mind that while the CRA legislation is fully passed, it's implementation is still an active work in progress. This means that things will change over time! 

Additionally: neither Ashley or Tracy are lawyers or accountants, though we have extensive experience working with both on the topic of open source and compliance. None of the content presented is legal advice and we strongly recommend folks seek their own counsel on these topics.
